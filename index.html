                            You know that's actually one of my favorite inside jokes that we have.<br>
                            I know it took long enough but I got you flowers! I looked all over target for peonies but I couldn't find any and these roses were the closest I could find.<br>
                            I'm not entirely sure what to talk about, I just had my big interview day today and honestly my brain is fried. But I wanted to make this because to me its important.<br>
                            I just came back from target too. I got you a fun card that I thought was pretty damn funny and a book by notorious RBG<br>
                            I hope you haven't read it before, I don't know if you have but if not then I think you'll like it.<br>
                            It reminded me of you when I saw it because she was a woman who stood up for her rights and the rights of women in America and I know that that is a passion of yours.<br>
    <img src="painting.png" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            I made you this! I know I'm not very good at painting but I think it came out really well and I'm proud of it.<br>
                            I missed just being able to hold your hand or have my arm around you and just walk for a bit.
                            <br>
    <img src="filter.png" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            I'm not entirely sure when or why we took this but I like and I saved it on snapchat for a reason.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I love you so much!
    <img src="wwebro.GIF" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            This is what I'd say if you told me otherwise!
    <img src="Beard.JPG" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            This was a really fun day and I had a wonderful time with you.<br>
                            There's nobody else Id rather spend my birthday with.<br>
                            And the view wasn't bad either! I'll let you decide which view I'm talking about ;)
    <img src="kisses.png" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            New hair who dis?? Going all dark on me now! But that's okay because I like it!<br>
                            Plus getting to kiss my favorite girl... what could be better??
    <img src="old.png" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            This is gonna be us in the future and honestly I wouldn't have it any other way.<br>
                            Except the man isn't wearing slippers so I'm not too sure about that... maybe Nala ate his!!!
    <img src="cutie.png" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            Who's that cutie! Just vibing in front of Old Chapel like you do.<br>
                            Looking mighty fine I might add, I highly recommend more photoshoots.<br>
                            I just like looking at you :)
