    <h2 style="text-align:center;">So umm... Hi Maeve...</h2>

</div>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">I know I only make these websites when times seem at their worst.
                                <br>
                            And I know that this actually shows some of the issues you point out to me. <br>
                            How I don't show my love or appreciation enough.<br>
                            I know I don't. I do love you, more than anything. You are the first person I tell anything to.<br>
                            You're who I go to. You were the first person I told about Charles River. If I have questions on anything or need advice I always go to you.<br>
                            I trust you.<br>
                            I also know that just like me, you have your limitations.<br>
                            I take full responsibility for physics. I know you can still do it and I'm very proud of you for continuing with it.<br>
                            It isn't incredibly easy but I know that if you genuinely sit down and focus and pay attention and attempt at the work, then you'll receive an A.<br>
                            I take responsibility for a lot of things. And even though I know this won't be a good metaphor (i think that's what it is), I'm going to say it anyways<br>
                            It's politics, there's two sides. And while it seems like both sides are against each other at times, they both want what is best for the collective whole.<br>
                            They go about things differently and have differing ideas about what will make things work in the best way.<br>
                            However, when things go wrong it is never one side's fault.<br>
                            It is also never one side's responsibility to fix.<br>
                            The best solutions come after days of talks and meetings to come up with solutions that benefit both parties and (hopefully) the collective whole<br>
                            Nothing can be fixed in a day, and that goes for anything in life.<br>
    <img src="M&M.jpg" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            Clear minds are what prevail. One cannot expect things to get better the next day and then be upset when they are not.<br>
                            I'm not saying this explicitly to you or me. This goes for all sides.<br>
                            To work towards a solution takes time and effort that both parties need to put in.<br>
                            Although I'm not a politician, my understanding of what politics should be is greater than most that study it.<br>
                            And I'm not being arrogant there, it's just logic of how the world needs to be to get things done.<br>
                            <br>
    <img src="haunted.jpg" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            From what I've thought about and said, I think there are things we both need to work on.<br>
                            I know I've been the quiet one in this relationship. I'm not much of a talker. I think that in order to help things I should say more about what is on my mind.<br>
                            But as all speakers know, saying more things aloud means nothing if there is no listener.<br>
                            This isn't something against you or anything, but sometimes I feel as though you don't really listen to me. I'm aware that most of the things I say are boring or hard to understand.<br>
                            And I don't mean it as you never listen to me because I know you do. All I ask is for a more open minded listening experience.<br>
                            That sounds like some new Disney attraction slogan or something.<br>
                            But in all seriousness, I want to know that I can always talk about  any subject with you and you won't dismiss it because it doesn't make sense to you or because it makes you upset or stresses you out.<br>
                            That's where some of these problems stem.<br>
                            I truly believe that we have good conversations, they just get cut off or I guess sometimes never truly start, because one of us just isn't interested.<br>
                            I know that CS is boring, especially if you don't know a lot about it, but I love it and I want to be able to always talk about it with you and share it with you.<br>
                            Sometimes I think I can't because I think you won't listen or 5 minutes into me talking about it you'll just change the subject.<br>
                            And this goes for me too. I know that I have done the same when it comes to you talking about something Disney or travel related. I'm trying to get better at it.<br>
                            I truly believe, and it is up to you whether you want to try it or not. But I truly believe that all issues with talking or communication can be solved by listening.<br>
                            <br>
    <img src="flowers.jpg" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            I know I don't show it but I really do love you and want to spend as much time with you as possible. <br>
                            I know you'd tell me that words don't mean anything if there's no actions.<br>
                            I know it seems as though I've made no actions at all.<br>
                            <br>
    <img src="car.jpg" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            But I have.<br>
                            I do everything I can to help you out.<br>
                            I always make sure I'm there for you whether you want me there or not.<br>
                            I always try to keep a smile on your face whether you think it's an appropriate time for jokes or not.<br>
                            I always share as much as I can with you, whether it be knowledge, food, money, or even just a place to sit and do work whether you want it or not.<br>
                            I don't do these things to get on your good side or because I want something. I do it out of love.<br>
                            Although I may not always directly say it, everything I do for you is out of love.<br>
                            <br>
    <img src="clap.jpg" alt="I love you" class="center">
                            That's why it pains me every time I hear you say that I don't say it enough.<br>
                            That's why I always seem so confused when you say that I don't say it enough.<br>
                            Because to me, everything I do, I do it for you.<br>
                            It's how I tell you that I love you.<br>
                            <br>
                            And I really do. Forever and always.
